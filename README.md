# Exoplanet Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`exoplanet_analysis.ipynb`) for analyzing exoplanet data using Python and scientific libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## 📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on exoplanet datasets
- Visualizations for distributions, correlations, and planetary features
- Statistical summaries and insights into planetary characteristics
- Customizable code blocks for further experimentation

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains over **5,000 exoplanet entries**, with the following features:

- **planet_type**: Categorization of the planet (e.g., terrestrial, gas giant, etc.)
- **mass_multiplier**: Planet's mass relative to a reference value
- **radius_multiplier**: Planet's radius relative to a reference value
- **orbital_radius**: The planet's distance from its star
- **orbital_period**: The planet's orbital period
- **eccentricity**: The planet's orbital eccentricity
- **distance**: Distance from Earth
- **stellar_magnitude**: Brightness of the star the planet orbits
- **detection_method**: The method used to detect the exoplanet (e.g., transit, radial velocity)
- **discovery_year**: The year the exoplanet was discovered
